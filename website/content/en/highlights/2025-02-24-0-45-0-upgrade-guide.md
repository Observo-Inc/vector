VRL version 0.22.0 included a couple of breaking Changes.

##  The`truncate` no longer supports the `ellipsis` argument

The `ellipsis` argument was deprecated. You can use `suffix` instead. For example:

```
truncate("A rather long sentence.", limit: 11, ellipsis: true)
```

becomes

```
truncate("A rather long sentence.", limit: 11, suffix: "...")
```


## `slice` VRL function

The `slice` function now preserves more type information on array elements. This might change its
fallibility in your VRL programs.
